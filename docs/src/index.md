# Cairn

Cairn is a privacy-first federated communication platform. Think Discord, but federated, end-to-end encrypted, and designed so the server operator never has access to your messages.

## Getting started

**Running your own instance?** Start with the [Quick Start](self-hosting/quickstart.md) guide — you can have a server running in under 10 minutes.

**Joining an existing instance?** Open the instance URL in your browser, or install the [desktop](clients/desktop.md) or [mobile](clients/mobile.md) app and enter the server URL.
