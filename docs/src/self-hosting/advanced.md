# Advanced Installation

These guides cover manual configuration, custom proxy setups, administration, and federation. If you used the [install script](quickstart.md), most of this was handled automatically.

- [Configuration](configuration.md) — environment variables, storage backends, SSL
- [Reverse Proxy](reverse-proxy.md) — Caddy and nginx configs with TLS (for manual setup)
- [Administration](administration.md) — cairn-ctl commands, backups, upgrades, Ansible
- [Federation](federation.md) — connect your instance to others
